   * Create a copy of a team. This operation also creates a copy of the corresponding group.
You can specify which parts of the team to clone: When tabs are cloned, they aren&#x27;t configured. The tabs are displayed on the tab bar in Microsoft Teams, and the first time a user opens them, they must go through the configuration screen. 
If the user who opens the tab doesn&#x27;t have permission to configure apps, they see a message that says that the tab isn&#x27;t configured. Cloning is a long-running operation. After the POST clone returns, you need to GET the operation returned by the Location: header to see if it&#x27;s running, succeeded, or failed. You should continue to GET until the status isn&#x27;t running. The recommended delay between GETs is 5 seconds.
